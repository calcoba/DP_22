Code generated for the Data Processes course from the Master of Sc. in Health & Medical Data Analytics (EIT Health) 2021-2022
This code has been generated by Carlos Alcoba, Javier Jimenez, Javier Paniagua and Javier Pozo

The project consist on two directories and one .py file. 

main.py: this file containes the core code for the application developed for the project. First the code will perform a preprocessing
of the data searching for outliers and cleaning the data in order to extract knoeledge from them. It will deal with each dataset
presented in a individualized way.
After that the code will execute the necessary algorithm to perform a data analysis in a covid19 dataset like the one provided in the data 
folder. The code will generate different plots corresponding to different exploratory data analysis techniques like correlations,
histograms, pair plots, survival functions... 
Following the code will train and evaluate four different models (Decision Tree, K Neighbors, Neural Network and Random Forest), 
for each of them a complete report will be displayed in the command line and a plot will be generated. Once they are all trained the
best model will be selected.
Finally the code will allow the user to enter new instances and make predictions with the best model founded.

 src: This directory contains a single .py file.
 
 functions.py: this file provide the created function used in the main.py file.
 
 data: This directory is where the files that are going to be analyzed must be placed for selecting them when executing the program.
 
 images: This directory will be created when the code is excecuted. In this folder the different images generated with the code will be saved.
 
 In this case the dataset used is COVID19_data.csv, the one provided for the project. The code is generated in a way that is able to deal
 with different dataset that follows the same structure as this one. The results presented in the technical results have been generated
 witht he COVID19_data.csv file, if other file is used the results could be different.
